                I am a student in Ada Developers Academy, a highly selective tuition-free full-stack software engineering program with an acceptance rate of less than 10%, dedicated to empowering women and gender-expansive individuals to break into the tech industry.                
                <br></br>
                With over six years of experience as a Product Developer in the fashion industry, I seamlessly transitioned from developing women's apparel to crafting web solutions. My background goes beyond creativity; it involves a strategic and solution-oriented mindset as I preciously worked extensively with cost, ensuring products met costing targets. This experience honed my ability to think creatively about alternate solutionsâ€”a skill I find particularly rewarding in programming, where there's always more than one solution to a problem.
                <br></br>
                As a full-stack developer, I specialize in Python, JavaScript, React, and more. My approach to work is grounded in teamwork, effective communication, and a commitment to continuous learning. I am excited to bring my creative yet analytical skills from my product development days to the tech industry, where I look forward to finding innovative solutions and making a meaningful impact by applying my technical skills and knowledge as well.
