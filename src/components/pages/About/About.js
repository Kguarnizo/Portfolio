          I am a software engineer with a background in fashion as a Product
          Developer, bringing a unique blend of creative and analytical skills
          to craft innovative solutions. My experience in fashion sharpened my
          ability to think outside the box and explore alternate solutionsâ€”a
          skill that seamlessly translates into programming, where multiple
          solutions to a problem often exist.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I am proudly trained in full stack development at Ada Developers
          Academy, a highly selective tuition-free program with an acceptance
          rate of less than 10%. During my internship at Oracle, I gained
          hands-on experience contributing to projects, collaborating with
          cross-functional teams, and applying my skills in Java, API
          development, and React. This experience allowed me to further develop
          my problem-solving and technical abilities.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          My approach to work is rooted in collaboration, effective
          communication, and a commitment to continuous learning. I look forward
          to finding innovative solutions and making a meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Outside of programming, I enjoy traveling and spending quality time
          with my dog Sunny.
